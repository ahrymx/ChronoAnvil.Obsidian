# Changelog

All notable changes to ChronoAnvil will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- **Visual tour screenshots.** Updated the visual tour captures with clean,
  sidebar-free screenshots taken from a freshly seeded development vault.
  Updated `dashboard.png` with a clean hero capture, `study-journal.png` with
  modern styling, and `section-composer.png` to demonstrate the active
  drag-and-drop section composer modal.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-07

First public release.

ChronoAnvil is a self-contained journaling, diary, habit-tracking and study
system for Obsidian. Everything below is drawn by the plugin itself — there are
no Templater scripts, no Meta Bind buttons, no Dataview queries and no external
chart plugin behind any of it. Obsidian's own **Bases** is still supported for
standalone `.base` files, and is the only thing kept.

### Added

- **A diary.** Daily and monthly entries, an overview calendar with heat maps
  and special events, week / month / quarter / year dashboards, full-text search
  filtered by date, tag and tracker, and on-this-day and timeline recaps. Every
  entry opens on its own head — the date, the title you give the day, the
  navigator to the entries either side of it, and the day's logging grid.
- **Journals you define yourself.** A journal is a folder tree with its own
  folder levels, note types, templates, commands and homepage section. Four
  presets ship ready to use — Study (*Subjects → Topics → Lessons and
  Practice*), Projects, Fitness and Media — and a journal you write yourself
  gets the same dashboards, indexes and charts they do.
- **One tracker registry, shared by both.** Trackers are defined once and appear
  wherever you put them: numberless rating scales, steppers, dropdowns,
  multi-row tag flow, habit pills, and bedtime / wake-up buttons that carry live
  sleep and wake durations. Any tracker can be added to a single entry on the
  fly without touching the registry.
- **Charts drawn from your own frontmatter.** Line, bar, calendar heat map,
  scatter correlation, streak and summary stat cards, rendered natively onto
  diary dashboards and journal indexes.
- **The week by the hour.** An interactive hourly scheduling grid with
  colour-coded blocks: drag down an empty column to block out a slot, drag a
  block to move it to another day or hour. Logbooks and task blocks sit beside
  it — named, standing lists for the work that belongs to the diary but not to
  one date.
- **Quick capture, and a search that reaches everything.** One box that stamps a
  line into any note with the time; and full-text search across the diary and
  every journal at once, filtered by date, tag and tracker.
- **A page you can rearrange.** Every ChronoAnvil page is a set of sections and
  widgets you can reorder by dragging, or compose in *Edit this note's
  sections…* — into rows of columns, into groups with pages, or welded into the
  page's banner as one card. The arrangement is written into the note in plain
  text, so the file always says what the page is.
- **Appearance that follows your theme.** Two aesthetic presets, five temporal
  grain palettes, page ground textures (dot grid, graph paper, scanlines,
  weaves) and vault banners — all built on your Obsidian theme's own colours
  rather than over them.
- **Vault scaffolding.** One command — *Maintenance: set up / repair vault* —
  writes the folders, dashboards and reference documentation, and repairs them
  in place afterwards. The notes it writes are compiled into `main.js`, so a
  community-store install has everything it needs from the three files Obsidian
  copies.

## Pre-1.0 development

ChronoAnvil was developed privately before this release. No build was published,
distributed or installed by anyone other than its author, and the notes for
those iterations are not part of this repository.

1.0.0 is the first version anyone else can install, and the first entry in
`versions.json` — which is the file Obsidian reads to decide which release a
given app version may install.
